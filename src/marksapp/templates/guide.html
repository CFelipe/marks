<h1>Hey</h1>
<p>Welcome to bmarks. This is a bookmarking website that organizes your links using tags instead of categories.</p>
<h2>Importing</h2>
<p>You can import your bookmarks from Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer, as long as they're in the Netscape bookmark format. Your directories will be converted to tags automatically. If you have a bookmark inside the folders "Photography -> Music" it'll get the tags "Photography" and "Music". If you have a bookmark inside the folders "Music -> Photography", it will get the tags "Photography" and "Music" as well.</p>
<h2>Adding bookmarks</h2>
<h3>URL</h3>
<p>That's the link to your bookmarked site. If you copy and paste it, the title will be fetched from the page automatically and added to the Name field as long as it is blank.</p>
<h3>Name</h3>
The name of your bookmark.
<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>Comma or space separated tags for your bookmark. "music, songwriting, people" tags a bookmark as "music", "songwriting" and "people". So does "music songwriting people". So does "music, songwriting people"!</p>
<h3>Descriptions</h3>
<p>When you add a bookmark, you can write a description for it using Markdown syntax.</p>
<h2>Viewing bookmarks</h2>
<p>You can sort bookmark listings by name or by date (most recent first).
  The description for a bookmark is hidden by default and can be seen by clicking on <code>[+]</code>. Clicking <code>expand all</code> will expand all descriptions, and <code>collapse all</code> will close all of them.</p>
<h2>Privacy</h2>
<h3>Public profiles</h3>
<p>If you set your profile to public, everyone can see your bookmarks unless they're tagged as "private".</p>
<h3>Unlisted tags</h3>
<p>If you prefix a tag with a dot, like ".notsosecret", bookmarks tagged with it won't show up if another user's browsing your tags or bookmarks, but you can still share links to that tag.</p>
<h3>Private profiles</h3>
<p>If you set your profile to private, nobody can see your bookmarks unless they're tagged as "public".</p>
<h2>Contact / Contribute</h2>
